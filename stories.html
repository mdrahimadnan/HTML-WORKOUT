      <h3>🌅 The Pebble in the Road</h3>
      <p>Once, a king decided to teach his people a lesson about responsibility. Early one morning, he placed a huge boulder in the middle of the main road to the city. Then he hid behind a nearby tree to watch who would stop to move it.</p>
      <p>Many of his wealthiest merchants and courtiers passed by, simply walking around the obstacle. They complained about how the king didn’t keep the roads clear, but none of them tried to move the rock.</p>
      <p>After many hours, a poor farmer carrying vegetables came along. He put down his load and used a stick to push and roll the stone off the road. It took him a long time, but eventually he succeeded.</p>
      <p>When he returned to pick up his vegetables, he saw a small bag lying where the boulder had been. Inside were gold coins and a note from the king, saying the reward was for whoever cleared the road. The farmer learned that every obstacle is a chance to improve life for everyone — not just himself.</p>

      <h3>🌻 The Broken Pot</h3>
      <p>A water bearer in India carried two pots hung on each end of a pole across his shoulders. One pot was perfect and delivered a full portion of water, while the other had a crack in it. By the time the water bearer reached his master’s house, the cracked pot arrived half-empty.</p>
      <p>For two years, this went on daily. The perfect pot was proud of its achievements, but the cracked pot felt ashamed and miserable for its imperfection. One day, it spoke to the water bearer: “I am so embarrassed. Water leaks out all along the path, and I fail you every day.”</p>
      <p>The water bearer smiled and said, “Did you notice that there are flowers only on your side of the path, but not on the other? I planted seeds there because I knew about your flaw. Every day, you watered them.”</p>
      <p>The pot realized its weakness had created something beautiful. The moral: our imperfections often make the world brighter in ways we can’t see.</p>

      <h3>☀️ The Starfish Story</h3>
      <p>One morning, a man walked along a beach littered with thousands of starfish washed ashore by the tide. In the distance, he saw a boy bending down, picking up starfish one by one, and gently tossing them back into the sea.</p>
      <p>“What are you doing?” the man asked. “There are too many. You can’t possibly make a difference.”</p>
      <p>The boy smiled, picked up another starfish, and threw it into the waves. “I made a difference to that one,” he said softly.</p>
      <p>The man stood still for a while, then bent down and joined the boy, throwing starfish back into the ocean. Sometimes, a small act of kindness may seem meaningless — until you realize it means everything to someone else.</p>

      <h3>🌈 The Bamboo and the Fern</h3>
      <p>One day, a man planted both bamboo and fern seeds in his garden. He watered them every day and gave them plenty of sunlight. The fern quickly sprouted and grew tall, covering the ground with vibrant green leaves.</p>
      <p>But the bamboo seed showed no signs of life. The man almost gave up, thinking it was dead. Still, he kept watering it, because he had faith.</p>
      <p>Years passed, and still no bamboo. But one day — after five years — the bamboo finally broke through the soil. In just six months, it grew over 80 feet tall. During all those years of silence, it had been growing deep, strong roots underground.</p>
      <p>Success often works the same way. You may not see results for a long time, but unseen growth is still progress. Don’t quit too early — your “bamboo moment” may be just ahead.</p>

      <h3>🍃 The Empty Jar</h3>
      <p>A professor once stood before his class with an empty glass jar. Without a word, he filled it with golf balls and asked his students if the jar was full. They all said yes.</p>
      <p>He then poured in pebbles, shaking the jar so they filled the spaces between the golf balls. Again, he asked if it was full. The students nodded.</p>
      <p>Next, he poured in sand, which filled the remaining space. Finally, he poured in two cups of coffee, which seeped into the sand. The students laughed.</p>
      <p>Then the professor said, “The jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things — family, health, friends. The pebbles are your job and home. The sand is everything else. If you fill the jar with sand first, there’s no room for the important things. And the coffee? It reminds you that no matter how full life seems, there’s always time for a cup with a friend.”</p>

      <h3>🌕 The Cup of Coffee</h3>
      <p>A group of graduates, successful in their careers, visited their old professor. Conversation soon turned into complaints about stress and life pressure. The professor offered them coffee and brought out an assortment of cups — some expensive, others simple.</p>
      <p>Each of them picked a fancy cup, leaving behind the plain ones. The professor smiled and said, “You all chose the nice-looking cups, but what you really wanted was coffee. Life is like that — jobs, money, status are just cups. They’re tools to hold life, not the meaning of life itself.”</p>
      <p>“The happiest people don’t have the best of everything. They just make the best of what they have.”</p>
      <p>When they left, everyone quietly realized they’d been chasing the cups instead of enjoying the coffee.</p>

      <h3>🕊️ The Window of Life</h3>
      <p>Two men were seriously ill in the same hospital room. One was allowed to sit up in bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the only window in the room. The other man had to lie flat all the time.</p>
      <p>Every afternoon, the man by the window would describe what he saw — a park with a lake, ducks swimming, children playing, and couples walking hand in hand. The other man would close his eyes and imagine it all vividly.</p>
      <p>Days passed and both grew close. But one morning, the nurse came to find the man by the window had peacefully passed away during the night. The other man asked to be moved next to the window.</p>
      <p>When he finally looked outside, he realized the window faced a blank wall. The man had described a beautiful world not because he saw it — but because he wanted to give hope. True happiness often comes from making others see beauty, even when you can’t.</p>
